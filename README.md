# satelliteLaunches

I've implemented a page with a table that takes data from the https://api.spacexdata.com/v5/launches/ API.
The table shows the name, launch date and the success status for some satellite launches done by SpaceX.
We can filter data in the table either by name, date or success status. We can also modify the amount of rows
shown by page of the table.

## Prerequirements
We need to install the libraries used by the application. We do this trough the command:
```
npm install
```
## Use
To run the application use the command:
```
npm start
```
